I started with raw data and explored it.
Built a robust preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline using TF-IDF.
Trained and evaluated strong baseline models (Logistic Regression, SVC), paying close attention to metrics beyond accuracy due to class imbalance.
I saw how to use the trained model for prediction.
Finally, I implemented a state-of-the-art Transformer model (BERT) for potentially higher accuracy.
